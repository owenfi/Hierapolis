Hierapolis is a log file analyzer for Amazon S3.

It is written specifically to make the logs from our podcast network (www.verbmill.net) easier to read but may work in more general cases (or be able to be generalized eventually).

The goal is to parse the logs into some sort of database and spit out a website that shows the important information.


To run:
    Set your home directory:
    ROOT=`pwd`
    Run the main script:
    scripts/run.sh
